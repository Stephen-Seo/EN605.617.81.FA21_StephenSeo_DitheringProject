# Dithering with OpenCL

## Background

[Project Proposal PDF](https://seodisparate.com/static/uploads/EN605.617.81.FA21_ProjectProposal.pdf)

The proposal mentioned dithering live-input frames, but I ended up with just
dithering single images or turning a video into dithered images.

The "develop" branch may have more up to date code.

# Other Notes

~~I plan on adding the MIT License to this project once the course (that this
project was made for) is over.~~

I went ahead and applied the MIT License earlier than noted here.
